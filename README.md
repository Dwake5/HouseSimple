<h1>Bit Shortener for housesimple</h1> 

<h3>By Danny Wakeling</h3>

<p>I have created this project for the second interview stage applying for a react role at housesimple, the specs are as followed:</p>

<p>We would like you to create a URL shortening service using a third party API such as bit.ly or goo.gl.

The main aim of the task is to see how well you architect a solution and to create a basis for discussion. Your code doesn't have to be feature complete. However, it should be written in an extensible way. We would rather see fewer features written well than lots of features written badly.

It should include the following as a minimum:</p>

<ol>
   <li>A page with a form to enter a URL, which on submit will display a shortened URL.</li>
</ol>

<p> No designs have been provided for the front end. It doesn't need to look fancy, but it should be clean and adhere to web standards.

Technologies used to implement the service should include but are not limited to React JS, HTML, CSS. All code should be written by you.</p>


<h2>Steps taken</h2>
<ol> 
    <li>'npx create-react-app url-shortener-housesimple' to create the base project</li>
    <li>'git init' to initialize git</li>
    <li>Fill in readme, documenting as I go</li>
    <li>Update logo at the top of website, change 'react app' to actual name</li>
